#  Internal Security Audit (NIST CSF) - Botium Toys  

##  Overview
This project is an **internal security audit** conducted for **Botium Toys**, a fictional small business. The audit follows the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** to assess security controls, identify risks, and recommend improvements.

##  Scenario  
Botium Toys is expanding its online presence, increasing IT security risks. The **IT Manager** has initiated an **internal audit** to:  
-  **Maintain compliance with cybersecurity regulations.  
-  **Identify risks in IT infrastructure.  
-  **Improve security posture and business continuity.  

##  Audit Scope & Goals
The audit focuses on:  
-  **Identifying & categorizing IT assets** (e.g., networks, servers, user accounts).  
-  **Reviewing security controls** (firewall, access management, encryption).  
-  **Assessing compliance** with industry standards.  
-  **Providing recommendations** to mitigate risks.  

##  Methodology  
This audit is structured using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Identify** - Asset Management, Risk Assessment  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Protect** - Access Control, Data Security  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Detect** - Security Monitoring, Anomaly Detection  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Respond** - Incident Response, Communication Plan  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Recover** - Business Continuity, Backup Strategy  

##  Key Findings
| Category         | Status | Notes |
