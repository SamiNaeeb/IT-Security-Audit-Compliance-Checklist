#  Internal Security Audit (NIST CSF) - Botium Toys  

##  Overview
This project is an **internal security audit** conducted for **Botium Toys**, a fictional small business. The audit follows the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** to assess security controls, identify risks, and recommend improvements.

##  Scenario  
Botium Toys is expanding its online presence, increasing IT security risks. The **IT Manager** has initiated an **internal audit** to:  
✔️ Maintain compliance with cybersecurity regulations.  
✔️ Identify risks in IT infrastructure.  
✔️ Improve security posture and business continuity.  

##  Audit Scope & Goals
The audit focuses on:  
- 🔹 **Identifying & categorizing IT assets** (e.g., networks, servers, user accounts).  
- 🔹 **Reviewing security controls** (firewall, access management, encryption).  
- 🔹 **Assessing compliance** with industry standards.  
- 🔹 **Providing recommendations** to mitigate risks.  

##  Methodology  
This audit is structured using the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**:  
1️⃣ **Identify** - Asset Management, Risk Assessment  
2️⃣ **Protect** - Access Control, Data Security  
3️⃣ **Detect** - Security Monitoring, Anomaly Detection  
4️⃣ **Respond** - Incident Response, Communication Plan  
5️⃣ **Recover** - Business Continuity, Backup Strategy  

##  Key Findings
| Category         | Status | Notes |
|-----------------|--------|----------------------------------|
| Firewall Rules  | ⚠️ Weak | Needs stronger filtering rules |
| Access Control  | ✅ Secure | MFA enabled for all accounts |
| Data Encryption | ⚠️ Weak | No encryption for customer data |
| Backup Policy   | ❌ Missing | No scheduled backups in place |

##  Recommendations
🔹 **Implement stricter firewall policies** to block unauthorized access.  
🔹 **Encrypt sensitive data** (customer info, transactions).  
🔹 **Establish automated backups** to prevent data loss.  
🔹 **Regular security training** for employees on phishing & social engineering.
